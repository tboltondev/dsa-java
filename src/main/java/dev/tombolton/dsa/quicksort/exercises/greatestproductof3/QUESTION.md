## Chapter 13 Exercise 1 (pg. 224)

Given an array of positive numbers, write a function that returns the greatest product of any three numbers. The
approach of using three nested loops would clock in at $O(N^3)$, which is very stow. Use sorting to implement the
function in a way that it computes at $O(N \log N)$) speed. (There are even faster implementations, but we're focusing
on using sorting as a technique to make code faster.)
