## Chapter 8 Exercise 4 (pg. 131)
Write a function that returns the first non-duplicated character in a string. For example, the string `"minimum"` has
two characters that only exist once - the `"n"` and the `"u"`, so your function should return the `"n"`, since it occurs
first. The function should have an efficiency of $O(N)$.
