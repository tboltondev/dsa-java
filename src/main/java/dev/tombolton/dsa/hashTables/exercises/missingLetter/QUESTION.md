## Chapter 8 Exercise 3 (pg. 131)
Write a function that accepts a string that contains all the letters of the alphabet except one and returns the missing
letter. For example, the string `"the quick brown box jumps over a lazy dog"` contains all the letters of the alphabet
except the letter, `"f"`. The function should have a time complexity of $O(n)$.
