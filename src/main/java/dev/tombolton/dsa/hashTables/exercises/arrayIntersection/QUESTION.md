## Chapter 8 Exercise 1 (pg. 131)
Write a function that returns the intersetion of two arrays. The intersection is a third array that contains all values
contained within the first two arrays. For example, the intersection of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]` is
`[2, 4]`. Your function should have a complexity of $O(N)$. (If your programming language has a built-in way of doing
this, don't use it. The idea is to build the algorithm yourself.
