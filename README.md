DSA fun with Java

While reading through the book [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/), I've implemented the examples and my solutions to the exercises. The examples used in the book are written in JavaScript, Python and Ruby but I've written them and my solutions in Java here to make it more applicable to my daily work.

The `main` module contains the examples and exercise solutions seperated into a package per chapter, and in the `test` module I've written unit tests for each example and solution.
