DSA fun with Java

In the `main` `dev.tombolton.dsa` package, there is a package for each data structure I have covered. Each of these packages follows
the structure described below.

In the `examples` packages for each data structure there are implementations for common algorithms explained in the book
[A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/).
The examples used in the book are written in JavaScript, Python and Ruby. I've converted them to Java
here to make it more applicable to my daily work.

In the `exercises` packages for each data structure I've written my solutions to the coding exercises from the book for each data structure.
Each package contains one solution and a README that contains the question. For any exercises that
ask you to modify some given code, I have converted that code to Java and included it in the README.

In the `test` `dev.tombolton.dsa` package, I've added tests for each algorithm.
